## We will use Gorilla Mux for handking routes and building Simple API server in golang

#### Add Gorilla mux dependency in app

```bash
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

#### Add UUID for Unique IDs

```bash
go get -u github.com/google/uuid
```

### Note, Since we are going to divide the files here, remember only 1 go file can be in root of project. This is usually `main.go` so other files will be kept in subfolders
