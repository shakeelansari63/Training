I asked o3 with Deep Research to try to find workarounds; it <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6817bbc3-3d0c-8012-9b51-631842470628\">confirmed the issue</a> and confirmed the workaround.<br/><br/>\n",
    "            The workaround is a bit of a bore. It is to take advantage of \"WSL\", the Microsoft approach for running Linux on your PC. You'll need to carry out more setup instructions! But it's quick, and several students have confirmed that this works perfectly for them, then the Week 6 MCP labs work. Plus, WSL is actually a great way to build software on your Windows PC.<br/>\n",
    "            The WSL Setup instructions are in the Setup folder, <a href=\"../setup/SETUP-WSL.md\">in the file called SETUP-WSL.md here</a>. I do hope this only holds you up briefly - you should be back up and running quickly. Oh the joys of working with bleeding-edge technology!<br/><br/>\n",

Use this tool when you need to examine the contents of a single file. Use the 'head' parameter to read only the first N lines of a file, or the 'tail' parameter to read only the last N lines of a file. Only works within allowed directories.\n",

Each file's content is returned with its path as a reference. Failed reads for individual files won't stop the entire operation. Only works within allowed directories.\n",

If the directory already exists, this operation will succeed silently. Perfect for setting up directory structures for projects or ensuring required paths exist. Only works within allowed directories.\n",

This tool is essential for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.\n",

Results clearly distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes. This tool is useful for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "directory_tree: Get a recursive tree view of files and directories as a JSON structure. Each entry includes 'name', 'type' (file/directory), and 'children' for directories. Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "move_file: Move or rename files and directories. Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation. If the destination exists, the operation will fail. Works across different directories and can be used for simple renaming within the same directory. Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n",
      "search_files: Recursively search for files and directories matching a pattern. Searches through all subdirectories from the starting path. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. Returns full paths to all matching items. Great for finding files when you don't know their exact location. Only searches within allowed directories.\n",
      "get_file_info: Retrieve detailed metadata about a file or directory. Returns comprehensive information including size, creation time, last modified time, permissions, and type. This tool is perfect for understanding file characteristics without reading the actual content. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
