### Scala has mostly 3 Visibility Options

| Visibility Options | Is Default | In class? | In Companion Object | In subclass? | In package? | Everywhere? |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Public             | Yes        | Yes       | Yes                 | Yes          | Yes         | Yes         |
| Private            | No         | Yes       | Yes                 | No           | No\*        | No          |
| Private            | No         | Yes       | Yes                 | Yes          | No\*        | No          |
| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |

### Private and Protected have No\*

This is because there is a way to define where is a variable visible by entering the scope after private/protected keyword

```scala
package org.scala.test
case class X(private[scala] val x)
```

This means the `X.x` will be visible inside the `org.scala` package  
So if there are other classes in `org.scala` they will be able to access it

```scala
package org.scala.test2
val x = X(2)
println(x.x) // Possible
```

But in other packages it is not possible

```scala
package org.scala3.test3
val x = X(2)
println(x.x) // Not Possible
```

Also there is `private[this]` which actually makes the variable not only private to a class, but also private to the instance of class
Meaning we cannot change the private value of one object from other object of same class

```scala
package org.scala.test
case class X(private[this] val x) {
    def update(y: X) = x = y.x // This throws error since we wont be able to access x property of Other object y from this class
}
```
