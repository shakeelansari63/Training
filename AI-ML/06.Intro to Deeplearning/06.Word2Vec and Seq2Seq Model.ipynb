This way, you can quantify and analyze word relationships mathematically. For instance, words like \"cat\" and \"kitten\" or \"cat\" and \"dog\" have vectors that are close to each other, while a word like \"book\" is positioned further away in this vector space.\n",

Additionally, you'll explore the GloVe model, and an **optional** summary will be provided to enhance your understanding of its application in natural language processing.\n",
    "## GloVe (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe, on the other hand, is another popular algorithm for learning word embeddings. It stands for Global Vectors for Word Representation. Unlike word2vec, which is based on predicting context/target words, GloVe focuses on capturing the global word co-occurrence statistics from the entire corpus. It constructs a co-occurrence matrix that represents how often words appear together in the text. The matrix is then factorized to obtain the word embeddings. For example, if \"Man\" and \"King\" co-occure many times, their vectors will be simialr.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GloVe model follows a fundamental approach by constructing a large word-context co-occurrence matrix that contains pairs of (word, context). Each entry in this matrix represents the frequency of a word occurring within a given context, which can be a sequence of words. The objective of the model is to utilize matrix factorization techniques to approximate this co-occurrence matrix. The process is illustrated in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a word-context co-occurrence matrix: The model begins by generating a matrix that captures the co-occurrence information of words and their surrounding contexts. Each element in the matrix represents how often a specific word and context pair co-occur in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply matrix factorization: Next, the GloVe model applies matrix factorization methods to approximate the word-context co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to decompose the original matrix into lower-dimensional representations that capture the semantic relationships between words and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Obtain word and context embeddings: By factorizing the co-occurrence matrix, the model obtains word and context embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations that encode the semantic meaning and relationships of words and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you can usually begin by initializing WF (Word-Feature matrix) and FC (Feature-Context matrix) with random weights.You will then perform a multiplication operation between these matrices to obtain WC' (an approximation of WC), and assess its similarity to WC. This process is repeated multiple times using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the error(WC'-WC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the training is complete, the resulting Word-Feature matrix (WF) provides you with word embeddings or vector representations for each word(the green vector in the diagram). The dimensionality of the embedding vectors can be predetermined by setting the value of F to a specific number of dimensions, allowing for a compact representation of the word semantics.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Skip-gram model is one of the two main architectures used in word2vec, a popular technique for learning word embeddings. In the Skip-gram model, the goal is to predict the surrounding words (context) given a central word (target). The main idea behind this model is that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.  Consider this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I was little bit taller,**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a context window size of 2, the words in red represent the context, while the word highlighted in blue signifies the target:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:red;\"> I was</span> <span style=\"color:blue;\">little</span> <span style=\"color:red;\">bit taller, </span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Window the Skip-gram:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the Skip-gram model using the actual context can be computationally expensive. This is because it involves predicting probabilities for each word in the vocabulary for each position in the context as opposed to CBOW that predicts the probabilities for each word in the vocabulary for the target word only. To mitigate this, several approximation techniques are employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approximation technique is to break the full context into smaller parts and predict them one at a time. This not only simplifies the prediction task but also helps in better training as it provides multiple training examples from a single context-target pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the first row of the table as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example above the target word is **\"little\"**. The full context for this target word is:\n",
    "**I was bit taller**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the approximation, instead of using the full context to predict the target, you should break it down. There are four approximations in this example:\n",
    "1. Approximation 1: **I**\n",
    "2. Approximation 2: **was**\n",
    "3. Approximation 3: **bit**\n",
    "4. Approximation 4: **taller**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each approximation, the Skip-gram model would aim to predict the target word \"little\" using just that part of the context. This means, for the first approximation, the model will try to predict \"little\" using only the word \"I\". For the second approximation, it will try using only the word \"was,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Skip-gram model aims to understand word relationships by predicting the context from a given target word. Approximation techniques, like the one illustrated, help simplify the training process and make it more efficient.\n"

As shown in the video, input is fed into the decoder part, one word after another. Each RNN cell receives a word($x_t$) and has an internal memory($h_t$). After processing the input and $h_t$, RNN cell passes an updated context vector($h_{t+1}$) to the next RNN cell. When the end of sentence is reached, the context vector is passed to the decoder part.

    "Let's first define the parameters that are used in __init__() function:\n",
    "- The `vocab_len` is nothing but the number of unique words present in the vocabulary. After pre-processing the data, you can count the number of unique words in your vocabulary and use that count here. This will be the dimension of the model input.\n",
    "- The embedding_dim is the output dimension of the embedding vector you need. A good practice is to use 256-512 for sample demo app like you are building here.\n",
    "- LSTM can indeed be stacked, allowing for multiple layers. In the initial implementation, you will use only one layer. However, to accommodate future flexibility, you will pass the parameter `n_layers` to specify the number of layers in the LSTM.\n",
    "- `hid_dim` is the dimensionality of the hidden and cell states.\n",
    "- `dropout` is the amount of dropout to use. This is a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look into the layers:\n",
    "- The Embedding layer takes the input data and outputs the embedding vector, hence the dimension of those needs to be defined as `vocab_len` and `embedding_dim`.\n",
    "- The LSTM Layer takes the `embedding_dim` as the input data and creates total 3 outputs: `hidden`, `cell` and `output`. Here you need to define the number of neurons you need in LSTM, which is defined using the `hid_dim`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the __forward__() function, the Embedding layer is defined that utilizes the `vocab_len` to internally convert the input_batch into a one-hot representation. Next, the LSTM layer receives the embedded input and outputs three vectors: Output, Hidden and cell. As for the encoder, you don't require the output vector from the LSTM as you only pass the context vector(`hidden`+`cell`) to the decoder block. Therefore, forward() only returns hidden and cell.\n",

    "3. It initializes a variable `epoch_loss` to keep track of the accumulated loss during the epoch.\n",

    "1. `evaluate(model, iterator, criterion)` takes three arguments:\n",
    "   - `model` is the neural network model that will be evaluated.\n",
    "   - `iterator` is an iterable object that provides the evaluation data in batches.\n",
    "   - `criterion` is the loss function that measures the model's performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The function starts by setting the model to evaluation mode with `model.eval()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It initializes a variable `epoch_loss` to keep track of the accumulated loss during the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function enters a `with torch.no_grad()` block, which ensures that no gradients are computed during the evaluation. This saves memory and speeds up the evaluation process since gradients are not needed for parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function iterates over the evaluation data provided by the `iterator`. Each iteration retrieves a batch of input sequences (`src`) and target sequences (`trg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The input sequences (`src`) and target sequences (`trg`) are moved to the appropriate device (e.g., GPU) using `src = src.to(device)` and `trg = trg.to(device)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The model is then called with `output = model(src, trg, 0)` to obtain the model's predictions for the target sequences. The third argument `0` is passed to indicate that teacher forcing is turned off during evaluation.  During evaluation, teacher forcing is typically turned off to evaluate the model's ability to generate sequences based on its own predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The `output` tensor has dimensions `[trg len, batch size, output dim]`. To calculate the loss, the tensor is reshaped to `[trg len - 1, batch size, output dim]` to remove the initial `<bos>` (beginning of sequence) token, which is not used for calculating the loss.\n",

    "* Note: When working with PyTorch tensors that represent data, it's important to understand the conventions around representing sequences. In most cases, the rows (the first dimension) in a PyTorch tensor represent individual samples, while the columns (the second dimension) represent features or time steps in the case of sequences. When dealing with sequences in PyTorch, it's common to use functions like `pad_sequence` to ensure that all sequences have the same length. Surprisingly, the padding operation is applied along the second dimension (columns), even though sequences are typically represented in the first dimension (rows). This can be confusing at first due to the way batches of sequences are represented. In many sequence-related tasks in PyTorch, especially when working with recurrent models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, batches of sequences are usually represented with the shape [sequence_length, batch_size, feature_size], where `sequence_length` refers to the length of the longest sequence within the batch(here it is equevalent to `src_len` or `trg_len`). If you check the src tensor above, you can see that the first word of of all sentences are in the first line, the second word of all sentences are in the second line, etc. That is why the first dimension is the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you use `pad_sequence`, it adds padding to the sequences in a batch so that they all have the same length, matching the length of the longest sequence. Since sequences are represented in the first dimension, the padding is applied along that dimension. As a result, the output tensor from `pad_sequence` will have the format [sequence_length, batch_size]. (Check the output for `src` and `trg` from the above cell.) This convention is commonly used because models like LSTMs expect the data to be in this format. However, if you're accustomed to working with more traditional tabular data in PyTorch, it can initially cause confusion. It's important to be aware of this convention to avoid potential errors and understand how to properly prepare and format sequence data for your models.\n"

    "## BLEU score metric for evaluation\n",
    "While peplexity serves as a general metric to evaluate the performance of language model in predicting the correct next token, BLEU score is helpful in evaluating the quality of the final generated translation.\n",
    "Validating the results using BLEU score is helpful when there is more than a single valid translation for a sentence as you can include many translation versions in the reference list and compare the generated translation with different versions of translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to one or more reference translations. It measures the similarity between the generated translation and the reference translations based on n-gram matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BLEU score is calculated using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision**:\n",
    "   - Precision measures the proportion of n-grams in the generated translation that appear in the reference translations.\n",
    "   - Precision is calculated for each n-gram order (1 to N) and then combined using a geometric mean.\n",
    "   - The precision for a particular n-gram order is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\\text{Precision}_n(t) = \\frac{\\text{CountClip}_n(t)}{\\text{Count}_n(t)}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $\\text{CountClip}_n(t)$ is the count of n-grams in the generated translation that appear in any reference translation, clipped by the maximum count of that n-gram in any single reference translation.\n",
    "     - $\\text{Count}_n(t)$ is the count of n-grams in the generated translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. . **Brevity penalty**:\n",
    "   - The brevity penalty accounts for the fact that shorter translations tend to have higher precision scores.\n",
    "   - It encourages translations that are closer in length to the reference translations.\n",
    "   - The brevity penalty is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  $$\\text{BP} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } c > r \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ e^{(1 - \\frac{r}{c})} & \\text{if } c \\leq r \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $c$ is the total length of the generated translation.\n",
    "     - $r$ is the total length of the reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BLEU score**:\n",
    "   - The BLEU score is the geometric mean of the precisions, weighted by the brevity penalty.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\\text{BLEU} = \\text{BP} \\cdot \\exp(\\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_n \\log(\\text{Precision}_n(t)))$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where:\n",
    "     - $N$ is the maximum n-gram order.\n",
    "     - $w_n$ is the weight assigned to the precision at n-gram order $n$, commonly set as $\\frac{1}{N}$ for equal weights.\n"
